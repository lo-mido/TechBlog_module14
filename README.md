# Tech Blog CMS - MVC Challenge

## Description
In this assignment, my task is to build a CMS-style blog site akin to WordPress. The website should allow developers to publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts on various tech topics. It should incorporate features like user authentication, creating, editing, and deleting posts, leaving comments, and more. The application must adhere to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm and utilize technologies like Handlebars.js, Sequelize ORM, and express-session for authentication. For a detailed list of requirements, please refer to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria sections.

## My Motivation
As a developer passionate about technology, I understand the significance of sharing knowledge and experiences. This assignment excites me because it aligns with my goal of creating an intuitive platform where tech enthusiasts can interact, learn, and collaborate. I am motivated to deliver a seamless user experience, ensuring that readers and writers find value in this platform.

## Installation
To install and run this CMS-style blog site locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository_url]`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add necessary environment variables like database connection details and session secret key.
5. Run `npm start` to start the local server.
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Upon visiting the site, users will be presented with the homepage displaying existing blog posts, navigation links for the homepage and dashboard, and an option to log in.
- Clicking on the homepage option takes users to the homepage.
- Clicking on other navigation links prompts users to sign up or sign in.
- After signing up and logging in, users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts. They can also comment on existing posts.
- The dashboard provides an overview of the user's created blog posts and the option to add new posts.
- Users can log out using the navigation option.
